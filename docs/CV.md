### Secure Authentication Service
###Portfolio Project, 2024-2025  
- Built a modular auth system with Node.js, Express, and SQLite, supporting email/password login and Google OAuth 2.0, with JWT-based access/refresh token flows.
- Implemented secure token delivery (HTTP-only cookies for web, headers for mobile) and optimized login performance to 200-300 ms using in-memory caching.
- Designed extensible architecture for future role-based access control (RBAC) to support scalable permissions.
- Validated functionality with Jest and Supertest, ensuring robust /register, /login, and /google endpoints, and documented API with cURL examples.
